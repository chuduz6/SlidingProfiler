NOTE: The example code makes use of Peripheral Library support available with MPLAB_C30 v3.11.

1. Code Example Description:
----------------------------
In this code example, I2C in PIC24FJ256GB110 is configured as Master. Device communicates with another device 
using I2C portocol using SDAx & SCLx pins.


* I2C Master is configured on  I2C1 available on device
* I2C MASTER: 	I2C1 Module
*
*Connections:
*		I2C1 (MASTER)															I2Cx (SLAVE)
*																				(Another Device)
*		SCL1 (pin 66)	<----------Pull up resister (4.7K) to Vcc--------------->	SCLx
*		SDA1 (pin 67)	<----------Pull up resister (4.7K) to Vcc--------------->	SDAx
*
* Pull up resister of 4.7K is necessary to tie the lines connecting SCL1 & SCLx to Vcc.
* Pull up resister of 4.7K is necessary to tie the lines connecting SDA1 & SDAx to Vcc.


2. Folder Contents:
-------------------
This folder contains the following sub-folders:
a. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\gld
        This folder will have the device GLD file, it is used for building the project. 
	This file was provided with the MPLAB?C30 toolsuite.

b. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\h
        This folder contains C header files useful in building this
        project. Device register and bit definitions are provided in
        the *.h file that follows the device name. These files were provided
        with the MPLAB?C30 toolsuite.

c. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\lib
        This folder contains library archive files, which are a
        collection of precompiled object files. The file
        named "libpic30-coff.a" contains the C run-time, start-up & Peripheral
        library. These file were provided with the
        MPLAB?C30 toolsuite.

d. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\src
        This folder contains all the C ,Assembler, Peripheral library source files (*.c,
        *.s) used in demonstrating the described example. This folder
        also contains a sub-folder named "obj" that stores compiled
        object files generated when the project is built.
		
e. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\src\peripheral_24F\include
		This folder contains the header files for all Peripheral library support.
		
f. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\docs\periph_lib\Microchip PIC24F Peripheral Library.chm
		This file contains the Peripheral Library description for all devices and modules.		


3. Suggested Development Resources:
-----------------------------------
		a. MPLAB IDE with MPLAB C30 v3.11 or above
        b. Explorer 16 Development Board with  PIC24FJ256GB110 controller

4. Reconfiguring the project for a different PIC24F device:
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Project/Workspace can be easily reconfigured for any PIC24F device.
Please use the following general guidelines:
        a. Change device selection within MPLAB?IDE to a PIC24F device of
        your choice by using the following menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Configure>>Select Device
        a. Change device selection within MPLAB?IDE to a PIC24F device of
        your choice by using the following menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Configure>>Select Device 
		
		b. To configure the device settings, either choose from the MPLAB IDE>>Configure>>"Configuration bits" 
		and configure for necessary settings or the corresponding configuration
		macros to be added into the code can be obtained from device.INC file 
		at the following default location:
		"C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\PIC24F\inc"
		These macros can be added as depicted in example code.

        c. Re-build the MPLAB?project using the menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Project>>Build All

        d. Download the hex file into the device and run.
